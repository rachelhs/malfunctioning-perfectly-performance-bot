Wild and untamed energy. My inner world went fast and it increased my speech, Alert, energised, wide-awake and/or agitated, panicked, chatty, bodily energised but also a rapid heart rate. I wanted to do things - dance around and lost inhibitions more. I would take it at my bar job to keep going - keep working and then be able to party afterwards. I would be hungry - insatiable hunger and I would not be able to sleep at all. The come down was horrible - head aching and tense in my body. Some people get aggressive on it. I am not strictly anti-drugs but I am also not advocating for drugs or self medication using these things - I am trying to show how these drugs whilst chemically similar  in structure - they are very different. I dunno. I am not a doctor but my specialist did ask about my past with street drugs and addition - many ADHD people do self medicate - even coffee can be seen as a stimulant self medicating. I know it is complicated but I also know that the difference between getting high and taking my medication for helping me function a little better is a very different experience - in fact I haven't felt the want to take drugs since I started taking my meds, but it is more than the chemical side - it is the being able to untangle my thoughts and have some clarity to my inner world. So if I compare this with my ADHD  drugs - when I take it in the morning, I usually have it with food and water. My eyes do not dilate, I do not feel high from them. I did not even notice anything at first. I wondered if it was a placebo. Then I noticed my thoughts that are usually fast and tangled - were clearer. It is like being in a messy room - the ADHD knows the piles of stuff  - horded like a magpie holds treasures and has it's place but because it has been out of sight out of mind - it can be hard to recall in short memory where the prized item you need is, then taking the meds - there is still piles of stuff but you can recall where and why it was placed there - the light was turned on in the bombastic room. However it does not as some think - make you want to Mary kondo tidy the room - this takes effort. I am not whizzing around the house like Magda from Something about Mary hoovering, off my tits, I am writing in my paper diary a to do list and trying to work out how long it might take me and if I have enough spoons of energy to do it.  Meh! I don't take the meds to be worrying about cleaning up, this idea of functioning in this way feels like a misdirection. Is it called a straw man? Plus at 6pm - when my meds run out - I am still ADHD and the symptoms of fast paced brain and other things come back. I would say I am still very ADHD on the meds. It is like how people think it will help them loose weight, my appetite is fine - I love eating and food, but I have disordered eating due to ADHD finding the task of cooking or forgetting I am cooking and burning food, or making what is perceived as a simple decision or forgetting what I have in the fridge which leads to throwing out food and feeling deep shame especially as it is wasteful and expensive to do this - or forgetting to eat due to ADHD but looking at the choices and feeling overwhelmed so it feels easier to reach for something quick to  elevate both hunger and frustration. Taking the meds has helped me stop and think to find structures that supports my every day living. Did I not answer the question? I am getting there ---- ADHD storytelling is dipping in past, nowness and future all for a more interesting ride, see '101 reasons small talk destroyed my will to live and this list is more interesting than your life' Do you enjoy small talk?

Sometimes they attribute our decisions and actions as if they are without volition, and without rationale, driven merely by lack of inhibition or of dopamine shortcomings. These models imply that ADHD is by necessity a problem and a shortcoming when it is absolutely and abundantly clear that at times, in the right circumstances the different way our ADHD minds work can produce results, projects, humour, businesses and ideas that are elevated above the norm, the neuro-typical. As an example it is hard to see there is not an extraordinary corellation, most likely causation between comedy, invention, and entrepreneurship and ADHD. Medical models aim to heal and alleviate the harsh symptoms but for many the ADHD is not the issue - it is the way if not given a chance to thrive, it causes these harsher symptoms.",

        "api_prompt": "What is it like to have ADHD? There is this integrated model of ADHD. I have felt the medical models of ADHD to be fundamentally flawed as the fail to explore the experience of ADHD. Sometimes they attribute our decisions and actions as if they are without volition, and without rationale, driven merely by lack of inhibition or of dopamine shortcomings. These models imply that ADHD is by necessity a problem and a shortcoming when it is absolutely and abundantly clear that at times, in the right circumstances the different way our ADHD minds work can produce results, projects, humour, businesses and ideas that are elevated above the norm, the neuro-typical. As an example it is hard to see there is not an extraordinary corellation, most likely causation between comedy, invention, and entrepreneurship and ADHD. Medical models aim to heal and alleviate the harsh symptoms but for many the ADHD is not the issue - it is the way if not given a chance to thrive, it causes these harsher symptoms. What is it like to have ADHD? In a desert... no not pudding... like a Earth desert... or Under stimulated - dry and desolate - glimmers of life and there - present but not interested. Think the pain of small talk. I am dead inside to this human ritual of pleasantries - I do not care for the weather, or who is getting married or why I should listen to some band that is dull, no I do not like that tv show but I have to smile and nod, urgh yuk yuk yuk What is it like to have ADHD? Focus likes interest based things - this can be far and wide and make no sense to onlookers... I have difficulty with low stimulation tasks, I get bored and drift off into inner imagination, not everyone has this even with ADHD.... It can either make me look rude or like I am not listening at all - I am I just have no poker face to how dull the conversation is and I am trying to figure out if I can either insert one of my own interests safely into the conversation and not be labelled a weirdo... or if I can slowly leave away from energy sucking vampire that has hold me hostage to look at baby photos for 15 minutes. Do not inner brain blurt out inappropriate thing about birth poop.... no do not say it... oh you did did you, they went away though.... do not shout bloody poop vagina rip hole..... What is it like to have ADHD? In this zone of the desert - it is where hyperfocus and hyperfixation lives. We pull up rocks and find lizards, we dig a hole and find water, each rabbit hole is exciting and we want to share our new interests or hobbies at the top of the mountain and see if anyone else just bites and wants to know stuff too.... What is it like to have ADHD? Look we can be really great for your pub quiz - well if it wasn't for the memory issues.. you know that thing ermmmm it's on the tip of my tongue, thingy, whatsymajiggy.... ermmmm.... it's like big but small and what is the word for it again..... it can affect the recall rote learning - so short term memory is poop. I am pretty good at those card memory games, but you told me your name I think and I have no idea what we just spoke about or what you are called... trivia that is not interesting just falls away - oh sorry I don't mean to sound rude - no you are not unimportant trivia - erm that is not what I mean... it means you told me your name and I did not imprint it into my recall memory by saying it in a sentence, so my brain noodle interprets it as less important that absorbing the room we are inside and what we are both wearing - this is experiential - I am in this moment with you and words just mush together sometimes... so when I say you know whatsaface has nice face, wears cute things - super smart, has dog called Henry, makes amazing cakes, funny, once did this dance that was about being a crab and needing to come out of our shells more often...is this not showing you I am absorbing things.... also it should be ok to ask your name again, bet loads of people forget mine. What is it like to have ADHD? Why is this a big issue beyond social situations? Well in learning - I am smart but I would not be able to answer the questions or have ways to learn in ways schools taught you - I would look for other things rather than be able to study sat at a desk... I was singled out a lot as naughty, attention seeking and it can seem like that but the colour by numbers lesson just set off the sand piling up in my head that forgot I was sat in a Geography lesson and the only thing I can think about is mountains are triangles and I wish I had a Toblerone.... Rachel can you tell me four features about the desert landscape? says teacher and all I say is Tobleroneeee. Sent out and detention What is it like to have ADHD? Stimulation seeking.... Ok this can manifest in several ways.... I like some adrenaline - rollercoasters for example - love them... but not being able to do task - to metaphorically get over the Wall of awful blocking me and leading to procrastination but then banging out the essay due in 5 hours deadlines anxiety - is not good.... perfectionism is a massive issues - oh dear inner brain noodle why is nothing ever good enough? Novelty of new things that peek my interest all of a sudden and re-direct my interest to feed my noodle brain, getting all excited at ideas or plans or stuff I want to buy....or games... or pattern seeking like I am suddenly this smart ass detective that must solve the secret codes to something that will not matter in 15 minutes - seems a bit like sabotage....

Brain wants variety of things - plates spinning - life in the fast paced lanes and it can lead to impulsivity...
