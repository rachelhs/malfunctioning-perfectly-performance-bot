I am so embarrassed you are right to be mad with me for being so late, no - I did not forget about you, yes I do care, I am so sorry. Yes I am listening.

Taking the meds helps me to unravel the what i call a noodle brain tangled thoughts, to absorb the things I am reading - so my short term memory is misfiring off the meds and there is a blockage at the toll bridge. I am still wiggling my legs as I say this - I have lots of inbuild wiggles to help my focus on a task.

            "1": "Urgh! So frustrating that people think it is the same as hard drugs. Ok, so there are two main categories of ADHD medications are stimulants and non-stimulants. ADHD medications work by improving the way certain parts of the brain communicate with each other. There is Methylphenidate type - which is Ritalin, I take a form of this called Concerta XL - it is a slower release form of the drug. There is also Amphetamine type, like Adderall. And stimulant types, like  Strattera, non-stimulant medications work by increasing brain activity of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine (NE), also called noradrenaline, is a chemical in your body that acts primarily as a neurotransmitter in your nervous system, but can also act as a hormone in the body. It plays a key role in many important functions.",
            "2": "Again I am not a doctor and this is a thing you discuss with a specialist doctor to work out if medication is the right route for you and to see how you respond to medication.

            "3": "There is such a stigma around ADHD medication and it leads to pill shaming, making people who take this medication feel bad for choosing this route. It is a personal choice to take the medication, pills don't teach skills and there are layers to finding what works for an individual on the spectrum of ADD/ADHD. I get asked a lot - Are ADHD meds Safe? Should I take ADHD medication? What are the dangers of stimulants? Are they addictive? Will they turn me into an addict? Will they fry my brain? Increase the risk of addiction? Lead to illegal drugs? How safe are they? Stimulants are the most-prescribed medications to treat ADHD, They have been around since the 1960's. Stimulant medications target a neurotransmitter (brain chemical) called dopamine to get across the little neurotransmitter bridge that is misfiring - it is different in different ADHD brains to how this is occurring and there is a lot of gaps in the research overall - which is why anti-meds folks use this as one of the reasons why someone should not take medication. I can only give how it has vastly helped me as my experience and what I have learned by reading about it in peer reviewed scientific papers and other sources. Urgh!

Wild and untamed energy. My inner world went fast and it increased my speech, Alert, energised, wide-awake and/or agitated, panicked, chatty, bodily energised but also a rapid heart rate. I wanted to do things - dance around and lost inhibitions more. I would take it at my bar job to keep going - keep working and then be able to party afterwards. I would be hungry - insatiable hunger and I would not be able to sleep at all. The come down was horrible - head aching and tense in my body. Some people get aggressive on it. I am not strictly anti-drugs but I am also not advocating for drugs or self medication using these things - I am trying to show how these drugs whilst chemically similar  in structure - they are very different. I dunno. I am not a doctor but my specialist did ask about my past with street drugs and addition - many ADHD people do self medicate - even coffee can be seen as a stimulant self medicating. I know it is complicated but I also know that the difference between getting high and taking my medication for helping me function a little better is a very different experience - in fact I haven't felt the want to take drugs since I started taking my meds, but it is more than the chemical side - it is the being able to untangle my thoughts and have some clarity to my inner world. So if I compare this with my ADHD  drugs - when I take it in the morning, I usually have it with food and water. My eyes do not dilate, I do not feel high from them. I did not even notice anything at first. I wondered if it was a placebo. Then I noticed my thoughts that are usually fast and tangled - were clearer. It is like being in a messy room - the ADHD knows the piles of stuff  - horded like a magpie holds treasures and has it's place but because it has been out of sight out of mind - it can be hard to recall in short memory where the prized item you need is, then taking the meds - there is still piles of stuff but you can recall where and why it was placed there - the light was turned on in the bombastic room. However it does not as some think - make you want to Mary kondo tidy the room - this takes effort. I am not whizzing around the house like Magda from Something about Mary hoovering, off my tits, I am writing in my paper diary a to do list and trying to work out how long it might take me and if I have enough spoons of energy to do it.  Meh! I don't take the meds to be worrying about cleaning up, this idea of functioning in this way feels like a misdirection. Is it called a straw man? Plus at 6pm - when my meds run out - I am still ADHD and the symptoms of fast paced brain and other things come back. I would say I am still very ADHD on the meds. It is like how people think it will help them loose weight, my appetite is fine - I love eating and food, but I have disordered eating due to ADHD finding the task of cooking or forgetting I am cooking and burning food, or making what is perceived as a simple decision or forgetting what I have in the fridge which leads to throwing out food and feeling deep shame especially as it is wasteful and expensive to do this - or forgetting to eat due to ADHD but looking at the choices and feeling overwhelmed so it feels easier to reach for something quick to  elevate both hunger and frustration. Taking the meds has helped me stop and think to find structures that supports my every day living. Did I not answer the question? I am getting there ---- ADHD storytelling is dipping in past, nowness and future all for a more interesting ride, see '101 reasons small talk destroyed my will to live and this list is more interesting than your life' Do you enjoy small talk? Oh... What is the weather like in the Wizard of Oz these days?"
